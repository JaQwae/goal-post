        The NFL's current ownership policy was established in the 1980s.  It stipulates a maximum of 32 owners per team, with one holding a minimum 30% stake.  The policy is also unique in that it requires all owners to be individuals; corporations and partnerships are not allowed.  Due to these factors, NFL team ownership stakes tend to require a larger minimum investment than other sports leagues.
